Needs:
'duration' class to store the duration of a 'Track', 'album' or 'album collection'
	DONE	this class should have 3 int variables, (hr, min, seconds)
	this class must implement the 'Comparable' interface (its a sorting algorithm)

'Track' class to store the details of an album track.
	DONE	this class should have 2 variables, (Title, Duration)

'Album' class to store the detail of a album.
	DONE	class should have 4 variables, (artist, title, year, collection_of_albums)

'AlbumCollection' class to store the details of a collection of music albums.
	DONE	this class should have 1 variable, (Album-objects)
	Done 	where the variable 'member' is just a collection of album objects


where each of these 4 classes should be their own separate .java file
and each class should have an appropriate set of getter/constructor functions
overwrite the "toString" method.

'Albumdatabase' class to store the main function.
	this class will read albums.txt




other notes:
DONE move main function inside main.java to "albumdatabase.java"
to find the first instance of a space. go back 2 chars this will be a ":" meaning its a song. if there is no ":" then its a album




extra notes/project ideas:

the queries might be  selection like such:

3)
not allowed to use GUI, was going to use a GUI to nicely display the information to the user
but as only the console output is used by pass when making the pdf to use.

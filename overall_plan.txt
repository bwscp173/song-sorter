Needs:
'duration' class to store the duration of a 'Track', 'album' or 'album collection'
	this class should have 3 int variables, (hr, min, seconds)
	this class must implement the 'Comparable' interface (its a sorting algorithm)

'Track' class to store the details of an album track.
	this class should have 2 variables, (Title, Duration)

'Album' class to store the detail of a album.
	this class should have 3 variables, (artist, title, album)

'AlbumCollection' class to store the details of a collection of music albums.
	this class should have 1 variable, (member)
	where the variable 'member' is just a collection of album objects
	this class should have the UI to answer "general queries regarding the content of the collection"

where each of these 4 classes should be their own separate .java file
and each class should have an appropriate set of getter/constructor functions
overwrite the "toString" method.











extra notes/project ideas:
under album the variable album could just be a pointer to the album?????? idk got confused

the queries might be  selection like such:
1)
select song by either
1. title
2. artist
3. album
4. length


2)
what is the (title|artist|album|length):
